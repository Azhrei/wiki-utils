# two steps documented in the README file before doing that.)

# This is a generated file and generally shouldn't be in the repo.
# However, generating this produces a huge network load on the MediaWiki
# server as *every* MTscript function page has to be downloaded.
# So... Does it belong in here? Yes. But I'm trying to be gentle to others.
